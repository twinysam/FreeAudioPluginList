A comprehensive list of audio processing plugins available for free download. Initially made by and for [/r/mixingmastering](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/), hoping it to be made by and for everyone.

This list was conceived so that people starting up in all forms of professional audio or trying to do it with limited resources, can have access to as wide a set of tools as possible.

No virtual instruments, that's a whole different category. We just cover processing plugins (including meters and whatnot), for mixing or mastering and sound design.

**Contributions are welcome**. You can submit a pull request, provided that you only add either a single plugin maker (and their plugins) or item at a time. Otherwise you can just [submit a plugin suggestion](https://github.com/twinysam/FreeAudioPluginList/discussions/new).
